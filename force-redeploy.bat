echo ðŸ”„ Force Railway Redeploy
echo.

echo ðŸ“‹ Current situation:
echo - Dependencies fixed (pydantic version)
echo - Dockerfile updated (correct entry point)
echo - But Railway still uses old version
echo.

echo ðŸ”§ Solution: Force redeploy
echo.

echo 1. Manual redeploy in Railway Dashboard:
echo    - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
echo    - Select subscription-tracker project
echo    - Click on disciplined-cat service
echo    - Click "Redeploy" button
echo.

echo 2. Or trigger new deployment:
echo    - Make small change to trigger auto-deploy
echo.

echo ðŸŽ¯ Let's trigger new deployment by updating README
echo.
